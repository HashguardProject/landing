      "question": "How does Hashguard protect my data?",
      "answer": "Hashguard uses a dual encryption system: your files are first encrypted on your device with keys that only you control, then a second layer of protection is added via iExec Data Protector. This approach ensures that even we cannot access your data. Additionally, decentralization ensures that your files are distributed across multiple nodes, eliminating single points of failure."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need cryptocurrency knowledge to use Hashguard?",
      "answer": "Not at all! Hashguard is designed to be accessible to everyone, regardless of technical knowledge. You can sign up and pay with a traditional credit card. Soon, web3 users will be able to pay with their favorite cryptocurrencies."
    },
    {
      "question": "How can I share my files with others?",
      "answer": "Hashguard allows you to share your files securely via temporary links to which you can apply restrictions such as an expiration date, maximum number of downloads, or password protection. You can also share entire folders with colleagues or friends by setting specific permissions (read-only, edit, etc.)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are encryption keys managed?",
      "answer": "At Hashguard, encryption keys are generated deterministically from your personal key. This key remains strictly in your hands: it is never stored, transmitted or accessible to third parties. All your files are encrypted end-to-end before being distributed over the decentralized network. So even the storage servers can't access your data. This architecture guarantees total confidentiality and absolute control over your files."
